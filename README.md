# Million Euro Website

Welcome to the Million Euro Website

The Million Euro Website is a creative fundraising project inspired by the legendary Million Dollar Homepage, reimagined with a modern twist and built entirely using my full-stack development skills.

The mission is simple and transparent:
to fund my wedding by turning pixels into opportunities for brands, creators, startups, and individuals who want visibility on a unique and memorable digital experiment.

Every pixel you purchase becomes a permanent part of the homepage — a living mosaic that grows over time — and links directly to your own custom online space.

How it works

Each pixel on the homepage has a fixed value of €10.
Depending on how many pixels you purchase, you unlock different levels of visibility and customization.

🟦 Starter Plan — 1 Pixel (€10)

- 1 pixel displayed on the homepage

- Clickable link to your website or profile

- Perfect for personal projects, shout-outs, or symbolic support

🟩 Growth Plan — 10 Pixels (€100)

- 100 pixels (10×10 block) on the homepage

- A custom landing page designed for you

- Space to present your project, brand, or idea

- Ideal for creators, freelancers, and small businesses

🟨 Pro Plan — 50+ Pixels (€500+)

- Larger pixel area with higher visual impact

- A fully featured website (multi-section or multi-page)

- Custom design, content structure, and responsive layout

- Great for startups, companies, or serious online presence

(Custom solutions are also available for larger pixel purchases.)
